It takes the image from the camera, detects the hand in the image and measures the distance between the thumb and pinky finger.
It uses opencv and mediapipe libraries to do this. 
According to the size of the measured distance, it changes the intensity of the led in arduino.
It uses the Serial library to connect to Arduino.
For other mathematical operations, it uses the math library.
